# Database management
### SSH tunnel options
You can use an SSH tunnel to connect to database from an external app (for example [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/), [HeidiSQL](https://www.heidisql.com/) or [PHPStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/phpstorm/configuring-ssh-and-ssl.html))
1. Uncomment ports directive in database service in `docker-compose.yml`

```
ports:
  - 127.0.0.1:${SSH_TUNNEL_EXT_PORT}:3306
```

2. Edit the `.env.main` file, find `SSH_TUNNEL_EXT_PORT` - make sure that the port is unique. If you are using multiple instances, change the port value.


3. Open your database management app and configure SSH tunnel, database connection


### phpMyadmin options
To use phpMyadmin need to run the phpMyadmin container first. It's not running by default.

1. Edit the `.env.main` file, find `PMA_EXT_PORT` - make sure that the port is unique. If you are using multiple instances, change the port value.


2. Run phpMyadmin container:

```bash
make pma
```

3. Open the `your-app-domain.com:PMA_EXT_PORT` URL in the browser to access phpMyadmin. For example, we use `PMA_EXT_PORT=8801`. Open `your-app-domain.com:8801`


⚠️  **WARNING 📣 Do not use phpMyadmin on public (production or open stage), it's not secure!**

### Reset database root password
1. In `docker-compose.yml` file uncomment `command: --skip-grant-tables` in mariadb service
2. Restart containers:
```bash
make restart
```
3. Enter inside mariadb container:
```bash
make exec mariadb
```
4. Inside container run:

```bash
 mariadb> FLUSH PRIVILEGES; ALTER USER 'root'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'new_password';
```
Where 'new_password' - new root password

You can reset another database user password too - just change the username, host, and add new password.

For example, there are two `root` users in database - with `%` host and with `localhost`. Use this command to see all users:

```bash
SELECT User, Host FROM mysql.user;
```

5. Revert back changes in `docker-compose.yml`

6. Restart containers:
```bash
make restart
```
