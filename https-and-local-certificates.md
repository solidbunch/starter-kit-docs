# HTTPS & Local Certificates

Secure your environment with HTTPS using self-signed certificates for local development or Let‚Äôs Encrypt for production.

## Production & Staging

**1. Enable HTTPS in environment:**

Set the protocol in your production or staging environment file:

```dotenv
APP_PROTOCOL=https
```

**2. Issue TLS Certificates via Let‚Äôs Encrypt:**

Run the built-in Certbot script:

```bash
make ssl
```

This will:

- Read `APP_DOMAIN` from `.env`

- Temporarily stop NGINX

- Run üîê Certbot in standalone mode (`port 80` must be open publicly)

- Save certificate files to:

  ```
  config/ssl/live/<your-domain>/fullchain.pem
  config/ssl/live/<your-domain>/privkey.pem
  ```

- Restart NGINX with HTTPS enabled

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è If the certificate already exists, the script skips renewal.
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Ensure `port 80` is open and not blocked by a firewall or ISP.

**3. Manual Certificates (optional):**

   You may manually place your certificates at:

   ```
   config/ssl/live/<your-domain>/fullchain.pem
   config/ssl/live/<your-domain>/privkey.pem
   ```

## Local Development

Let‚Äôs Encrypt does **not** issue certificates for local domains like `.localhost`. Use self-signed certificates instead.

### Option 1: mkcert (recommended)

Install [`mkcert`](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) and run:

```bash
mkcert -install
mkcert myproject.localhost
```

This creates two files, e.g.:

```
myproject.localhost.pem
myproject.localhost-key.pem
```

Rename and copy them to:

```
config/ssl/live/myproject.localhost/fullchain.pem
config/ssl/live/myproject.localhost/privkey.pem
```

Then update your local environment type file at `config/environment/.env.type.local`, or create an override file at  
`config/environment/.env.type.local.override`.

> ‚û°Ô∏è See [Environment Configuration](environment-configuration.md) for details.

```dotenv
APP_PROTOCOL=https
```

Start your environment:

```bash
make up
```

> üìå Local HTTPS support assumes your domain matches the certificate. Adjust your `/etc/hosts` accordingly.

### Option 2: Manual Self-Signed Certificates

Generate self-signed certificates using OpenSSL:

```bash
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
  -keyout config/ssl/live/myproject.localhost/privkey.pem \
  -out config/ssl/live/myproject.localhost/fullchain.pem \
  -subj "/CN=myproject.localhost"
```

This creates a self-signed certificate valid for 365 days.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Self-signed certificates will trigger browser warnings. You can bypass them for local development.
> To avoid warnings, you can add the self-signed certificate to your system's trusted certificates store.
> 
> See [Letsencrypt Documentation](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/certificates-for-localhost/) for more details on using self-signed certificates locally.

## ‚Üª Switching to HTTPS and redirects

The NGINX setup supports both HTTP and HTTPS, with automatic redirection configured via:

* `config/nginx/config/http.conf.template` ‚Äî used when `APP_PROTOCOL=http`
* `config/nginx/config/https.conf.template` ‚Äî used when `APP_PROTOCOL=https`

Redirection behavior:

* HTTP ‚Üí HTTPS
* `www.domain` ‚Üí `domain`

> Configuration is automatically templated and mounted at container start. No manual edits are required in `*.conf` files.
