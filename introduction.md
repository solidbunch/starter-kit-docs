# StarterKit Foundation Documentation

## Introduction and Goals

**StarterKit Foundation** is a baseline WordPress environment template built for rapid project initiation.  
It provides a **preconfigured Docker-based infrastructure**, simplifies the handling of **sensitive data**, and supports **flexible configuration** across multiple environments.

The **primary goal** of the project is to **streamline the deployment process** for developers and DevOps engineers — from local development to full-scale production.  
The solution includes several integrated components — **containers**, **scripts**, and **configuration layers** — which **automate repetitive tasks** and **enforce a standardized project structure**.

As a result, developers can **focus entirely on writing WordPress code**, instead of spending time configuring and maintaining the environment.

This stack **combines a custom WordPress theme with a fully integrated Bootstrap-based front-end**.


### Primary Goals

- **Rapid setup** – Get a working WordPress site with Docker in minutes.
- **Modern tooling** – Composer, Node.js, Laravel Mix, SCSS/JS compilation, and Carbon Fields are included out-of-the-box.
- **Environment parity** – The same code and containers run locally, on staging, and in production.
- **Built-in DevOps** – Terraform, Ansible, and GitHub Actions pipelines automate infrastructure provisioning and deployments.
- **Extensibility** – Open-source (MIT) and designed for easy customization.

## Project Overview

StarterKit Foundation is a baseline WordPress environment template engineered for quick project onboarding. It delivers a ready-made Docker infrastructure, streamlined secret handling, and flexible environment configuration. Its mission is to simplify the job of developers and DevOps engineers when spinning up WordPress sites—from local development through production.

### Key Advantages

- **Quick start** – Spin up a full local WordPress stack with `make install`. The command builds containers, installs WordPress, required packages, and prepares the database automatically.
- **Convenient configuration** – All parameters (application name, domains, ports, keys, etc.) live in layered `.env` files. Secrets are stored separately and generated automatically for improved security.
- **Universal environment** – Containers cover the web server, PHP/WordPress, the database, plus helper services like Node.js, phpMyAdmin, and MailHog. This supports both developers (asset builds, live reload) and DevOps (DB management, backups, CI/CD).
- **Scalable to production** – Terraform describes cloud infrastructure, while Ansible automates software installation on servers, applying the same configuration patterns on staging and production.
- **Open-source & extensible** – Distributed under the MIT license and structured for community contributions. You can extend scripts and code to suit specific needs without breaking the core architecture.

This overview section helps developers, DevOps engineers, and technical administrators quickly understand what StarterKit Foundation is and which problems it solves.
